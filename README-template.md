## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM
- SMACSS
- NAMESPACES


### What I learned

Project focused on applying the main CSS conventions, such as BEM, SMACSS, and NAMESPACES. It is responsive and prepared for any screen size.

See below some examples:

```html
<header class="l-header u-mobile-padding-inline"> <!--here I used NAMESPACES convention with "l-" (layout) and "u-"(utilities)-->
```

```css
/* BEM example */
.c-services__content {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: flex-end;
}
```
